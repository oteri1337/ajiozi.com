                It started with a question. Is there a better way to automate
                and secure facility, residence, public buildings and data?
                Passionate about such question, Ajiozi found the answers but
                didnâ€™t stop there.
              </p>

              <p>
                What is the global potential for transforming data into
                intelligence? What is the socio-economic value that an
                innovative security solutions would bring to users and the
                environment? Who else might benefit from using our new
                technologies? These present a wide range of opportunities that
                we are exploring.
              </p>

              <p>
                Admittedly, organisations and residence face complex security
                challenges and business risk. Understanding these challenges and
                responding with innovative solutions to keep the people and
                business safe is one of our core values.
